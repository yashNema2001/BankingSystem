3. Balance Inquiry: Users can check their account balance.
4. Fund Transfer: Users can transfer money between different accounts.
5. Database Integration: All data is stored in a relational database using JDBC.

# Technologies Used
1. Java: Core programming language used for implementing the business logic.
2. JDBC: Java Database Connectivity API used to interact with the database.
3. MySQL: The relational database management system used for storing banking data.
4. Maven: Used for managing project dependencies and building the project.
